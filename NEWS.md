# radlibs 0.1.0

Welcome to radlibs! This package contains functions to take a phrase or passage of text and substitute
the words "noun" or "verb" (or others) with silly words from the same part of speech. The README file
gives full details about what is supported.

A prior beta version of this package included a more complex part of speech tagger, but because this 
required Java support and was causing some trouble for users, I have removed that for now. The basic 
part of speech tagger includes around 250,000 words so this should work for most.
